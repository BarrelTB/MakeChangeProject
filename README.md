## Make Change Project

### Overview

This is a simulated cash register. The user will be prompted to input the price (of the "customers" item), then the user is prompted to input the amount paid. If the amount paid is smaller than the price, an appropriate error message will be shown. If the amount paid is equal to or over the price, the correct amount of change will be issued back.
