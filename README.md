## Make Change Project

### Overview

This is a simulated cash register. The user will be prompted to input the price (of the "customers" item), then the user is prompted to input the amount paid. If the amount paid is smaller than the price, an appropriate error message will be shown. If the amount paid is equal to or over the price, the correct amount of change will be issued back.

### Concepts

+ Utilizing methods in properly refactoring code.
+ Getting into using objects to call upon the Make Change app.
+ Using various imports to round doubles.
+ Utilizing if statements to properly sort results.
+ 

### Technologies Used

+ Java
+ While-loops
+ If-statements
+ Methods (public void and return methods)
+ public variables

### Lessons Learned

The greatest lesson I've learned in this project is to not over think the solution. Sometimes it's better to go the simple route so that the finished project meets all requirements without error. Trying to shorten code via complex answer can cause the program to have bugs or to not pass the required test variables.

+ Importing various tools

+ Utilizing numerous methods

+ Creating an instance of an object
